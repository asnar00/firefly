# title

[[the title of the function, in 10 words or less]]

# purpose

[[the purpose of the function, in a single paragraph of less than 140 characters]]

# pseudocode

[[Pseudocode for the function. Pseudocode consists of one line of English text per line of code, describing what that line does. Each line should be indented to the same amount as the original line, and start with a hyphen ("-"). If the original line calls any of the listed components, add the component id in brackets at the appropriate place. Since the human reader is pressed for time, this text should be as terse as possible without losing crucial information. Do not use variable or function names; instead describe what the code is doing. Omit pseudocode for the function declaration itself.]]
